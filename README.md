## Overview

`artic` is a pipeline and set of accompanying tools for working with viral nanopore sequencing data, generated from tiling amplicon schemes.

It is designed to help run the artic bioinformatics protocols; for example the [SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html).

Features include:

- read filtering
- primer trimming
- amplicon coverage normalisation
- variant calling
- consensus building

<!-- ## Installation

### Via conda

```sh
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge artic
```

Please make sure you are using either mamba or conda version >= 23.10.0 where libmamba solver was made the default conda solver. -->

### Via source

#### 1. downloading the source:

<!-- Download a [release](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics/releases) or use the latest master (which tracks the current release): -->

Clone the repository then checkout the 1.4.0-dev branch to test the 1.4.0 pre-release.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics
cd fieldbioinformatics
```

#### 2. installing dependencies:

The `artic pipeline` has several [software dependencies](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics/blob/master/environment.yml). You can solve these dependencies using the minimal conda environment we have provided, Please make sure you are using either mamba or conda version >= 23.10.0 where libmamba solver was made the default conda solver.
:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate artic
```

#### 3. installing the pipeline:

```sh
pip install .
```

#### 4. testing the pipeline:

First check the pipeline can be called.

```
artic -v
```

You can try the pipeline tests.

```
./test-runner.sh clair3
```

For further tests, such as the variant validation tests, check [the documentation](http://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests?badge=latest).

## Documentation

Documentation for the `artic pipeline` is available via [read the docs](http://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
